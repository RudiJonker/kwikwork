Summary for Next Chat
App Name

kwikwork

Purpose

The kwikwork app is designed to provide a dashboard-based interface for job seekers, employers, and administrators, featuring role-specific content (e.g., job rankings for seekers, job posts for employers, and admin stats). It includes a scrolling banner, role-based cards, and bottom navigation tabs, leveraging Supabase for authentication and user data management.

Target Audience

Job seekers, employers, and administrators managing or utilizing job-related services through the platform.

Our Current Project Status

The app now successfully loads the dashboard screen after login, displaying a scrolling banner, role-based cards, and bottom navigation tabs.
All previous errors (e.g., Supabase initialization, TouchableOpacity, role fetch) have been resolved.
The cards are populated but may not reflect the correct user role due to a potential missing user record in the users table or incomplete role assignment. An auto-insert mechanism was added to create a default 'seeker' role if no record exists.
The last successful log showed user 4dbf4168-d4e4-4aab-8187-2e1d2750ee17 (email: ww1@kw.com) fetched, with a role fetch error due to a missing record, now addressed by the auto-insert.

Relevant Information for Next Chat

Key Progress: The dashboard is functional, with the primary issue being card alignment to the user’s role. The auto-insert feature should populate the users table, but manual role adjustment (e.g., via Supabase dashboard) may be needed for accuracy.
Next Steps: Tweak card display logic to ensure role-specific content matches the fetched or default role. Verify the auto-insert works and adjust roles as needed (e.g., update to 'employer' or 'admin' for ww1@kw.com).
Debug Tips: Check the console logs for insert success/failure and the resulting role. If cards remain scrambled, inspect the getCards() function logic against the fetched role state.
Supabase Considerations: Ensure RLS policies allow the auto-insert operation. If blocked, temporarily disable RLS or adjust the policy to allow inserts by authenticated users.
Environment Notes: The use of Expo and React Native 0.79.5 with React 19.0.0 suggests a modern setup—watch for compatibility with future updates.
Git Workflow: Continue using the feature/dashboard-layout branch for tweaks, merging to main once stable.

Recommendation

Start the new chat with the latest DashboardScreen.js log output to confirm the auto-insert and role fetch. Share any desired role adjustments for ww1@kw.com (e.g., 'employer' instead of 'seeker').
Bring up any specific card display issues (e.g., layout, missing data) to prioritize tweaks.
