Hey Grok. We are developing a mobile app together and this is a continuation of our earlier chats. Please see the summary below which you prepared for this chat to bring you up to speed:

New Chat Summary: Kwikwork App Development
App Description
Kwikwork is a mobile application designed to connect employers and seekers for short-term job opportunities. The app allows employers to post job listings with details such as job category, location, date/time, duration, and payment, while seekers can browse and apply for these jobs. The focus is on a user-friendly interface with features like category selection, location input with autofill, and a seamless posting/submission process.
Target Audience

Employers: Individuals or businesses needing short-term labor (e.g., gardening, cleaning, construction) in local areas.
Seekers: Workers looking for flexible, quick job opportunities, likely in urban or suburban regions.
Primarily aimed at users in South Africa (based on context clues like SAST timezone), but expandable globally.

App Flow

Login/Signup: Users authenticate via Supabase (email/password or phone number).
Dashboard: After login, users see a dashboard with options:

Employers: "New Job" card to create a listing.
Seekers: Job listings to browse/apply.


New Job Screen (Employer Flow):

Select job categories (multi-select dropdown with wrapping cards).
Enter location (with autofill to prevent spelling errors).
Set date/time (from/to).
Input duration (calculated from from/to times) and payment.
Submit the job listing.


Job Listings: Seekers view posted jobs with filters (e.g., location, category).
Profile Management: Users can update profiles (e.g., contact info, availability).

Supabase Schema Details

Users Table:

id (UUID, primary key)
user_number (integer, unique, auto-increment)
name (text, not null)
email (text, not null)
phone (text, not null)
role (text, not null, default 'seeker')
created_at (timestamp with time zone, nullable, default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
profile_pic (text, nullable)
bio (text, nullable)
business_name (text, nullable)


Jobs Table:

id (UUID, primary key, default uuid_generate_v4())
employer_id (UUID, foreign key to Users.id, not null)
category (text, not null)
location (text, not null)
date (date, not null)
time_from (time without time zone, not null)
time_to (time without time zone, not null)
duration (numeric, not null)
payment (numeric, not null)
currency (text, not null)
created_at (timestamp with time zone, nullable, default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
status (text, not null, default 'open')


Policies:

Employers can manage own jobs (public, qual: auth.uid() = employer_id)
Seekers can view open jobs (public, qual: status = 'open')
Users can insert own data (public, with_check: auth.uid() = id)
Users can update own data (public, qual: auth.uid() = id, with_check: auth.uid() = id)
Users can view own data (public, qual: auth.uid() = id)


Notes: Schema updated with exact details from your Supabase setup. No Applications table is present yet, but it can be added later for seeker applications.

GitHub Link

Repository: https://github.com/RudiJonker/kwikwork
Current Branches:

job-category-field: Last working state with Job Category dropdown and wrapping cards.
location-field: Recently reset to match job-category-field as a clean slate.
date-time-fields: Current working branch with full New Job screen implementation (category, location, date/time, hours, payment fields).



Development Environment

Operating System: Windows (based on file paths like C:\Users\rudij\).
Node.js: Compatible with dependencies (assumed latest LTS, e.g., 20.x).
Package.json Dependencies:
json"dependencies": {
  "@expo/vector-icons": "^14.1.0",
  "@react-native-community/checkbox": "^0.5.17",
  "@react-navigation/bottom-tabs": "^7.4.6",
  "@react-navigation/native": "^7.1.17",
  "@react-navigation/stack": "^7.4.7",
  "@supabase/supabase-js": "^2.55.0",
  "expo": "~53.0.20",
  "expo-image-picker": "~16.1.4",
  "expo-status-bar": "~2.2.3",
  "react": "19.0.0",
  "react-native": "0.79.5",
  "react-native-dotenv": "^3.4.11",
  "react-native-get-random-values": "^1.11.0",
  "react-native-phone-number-input": "^2.1.0",
  "react-native-safe-area-context": "^5.4.0",
  "react-native-screens": "~4.11.1",
  "@react-native-community/datetimepicker": "^8.0.0", // Added for DateTimePicker
  "react-native-modal-datetime-picker": "^17.1.0" // Added for modal picker
},
"devDependencies": {
  "@babel/core": "^7.20.0"
}

Expo SDK: 53.0.20 (managed workflow).
React Native: 0.79.5.
JavaScript Engine: Hermes (default with Expo 53).
IDE: Likely VS Code (based on TypeScript error format).

Current Status

The app is fully functional on the date-time-fields branch with a complete New Job screen:

CategoryField: Multi-select dropdown with wrapping cards.
LocationField: Input with Geoapify autofill (implemented earlier).
DateTimeFrom/DateTimeTo: Operational with react-native-modal-datetime-picker (fixed TypeError issue).
HoursField: Calculates duration from fromDate to toDate, displays as "X.X Hours".
PaymentField: Simplified to a numeric input (currency logic deferred).


All fields are left-aligned and full-width after styling updates.
Previous issues (e.g., Geoapify TypeScript errors, DateTimePicker dismissal) are resolved.
Memory constraints notedâ€”current session may need to end soon.

Next Goal

Add submission logic to save the New Job form data to the Supabase jobs table.
Optionally, enhance the form with validation or integrate user authentication for employer_id.

Additional Notes

Geoapify API Key: 61449e72d36d4499bb2467b8e8cdc167 (handled via hardcoded temp or react-native-dotenv).
Timezone: SAST (South Africa Standard Time), current date/time: 09:13 PM SAST, Friday, August 22, 2025.
User Preference: Concise feedback, no deep code explanations, research compatibility before new dependencies, ask for file content if needed for edits.
Deferred Feature: Currency symbol based on phone number (to be implemented in a new chat due to memory constraints).

Action Items for New Chat

Provide code for submitting the New Job form to Supabase, including mapping form data to the jobs table columns.
Include test steps and Git commands to commit changes to date-time-fields.
Request confirmation of user authentication setup (e.g., how to get auth.uid() for employer_id) if not yet integrated.
Revisit currency logic for PaymentField using the phone number or another method.
