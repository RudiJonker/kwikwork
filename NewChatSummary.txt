New Chat Summary: Kwikwork App Development
App Description
Kwikwork is a mobile application designed to connect employers and seekers for short-term job opportunities. The app allows employers to post job listings with details such as job category, location, date/time, duration, and payment, while seekers can browse and apply for these jobs. The focus is on a user-friendly interface with features like category selection, location input with autofill, and a seamless posting/submission process.
Target Audience

Employers: Individuals or businesses needing short-term labor (e.g., gardening, cleaning, construction) in local areas.
Seekers: Workers looking for flexible, quick job opportunities, likely in urban or suburban regions.
Primarily aimed at users in South Africa (based on context clues like SAST timezone), but expandable globally.

App Flow

Login/Signup: Users authenticate via Supabase (email/password or phone number).
Dashboard: After login, users see a dashboard with options:

Employers: "New Job" card to create a listing.
Seekers: Job listings to browse/apply.


New Job Screen (Employer Flow):

Select job categories (multi-select dropdown with wrapping cards).
Enter location (with autofill to prevent spelling errors).
Set date/time (from/to).
Input duration and payment.
Submit the job listing.


Job Listings: Seekers view posted jobs with filters (e.g., location, category).
Profile Management: Users can update profiles (e.g., contact info, availability).

GitHub Link

Repository: https://github.com/RudiJonker/kwikwork
Current Branches:

job-category-field: Last working state with Job Category dropdown and wrapping cards.
location-field: Recently overwritten with job-category-field as a fresh starting point.



Development Environment

Operating System: Windows (based on file paths like C:\Users\rudij\).
Node.js: Compatible with dependencies (assumed latest LTS, e.g., 20.x).
Package.json Dependencies:
json"dependencies": {
  "@expo/vector-icons": "^14.1.0",
  "@react-native-community/checkbox": "^0.5.17",
  "@react-navigation/bottom-tabs": "^7.4.6",
  "@react-navigation/native": "^7.1.17",

  "react-native-get-random-values": "^1.11.0",
  "react-native-phone-number-input": "^2.1.0",
  "react-native-safe-area-context": "^5.4.0",
  "react-native-screens": "~4.11.1"
},
"devDependencies": {
  "@babel/core": "^7.20.0"
}

Expo SDK: 53.0.20 (managed workflow).
React Native: 0.79.5.
JavaScript Engine: Hermes (default with Expo 53).
IDE: Likely VS Code (based on TypeScript error format).

Current Status

The app is functional up to the job-category-field branch, with a working New Job screen featuring a category selection dropdown and wrapping cards.
The location-field branch has been reset to match job-category-field, providing a clean slate.
Previous attempts to add Geoapify autofill with react-native-fs caused TypeScript errors and runtime issues (e.g., [runtime not ready]: TypeError: Cannot read property 'RNSFileTypeRegular' of null).

Next Goal

Implement the Location field with Geoapify autofill to prevent spelling errors for suburbs or towns.
Use a different approach (e.g., react-native-webview) to avoid previous issues, leveraging your prior success with Geoapify.

Additional Notes

Geoapify API Key: 61449e72d36d4499bb2467b8e8cdc167 (to be handled securely, e.g., via react-native-dotenv or hardcoded temporarily).
Timezone: SAST (South Africa Standard Time), current date/time: 11:22 AM SAST, Friday, August 22, 2025.
User Preference: Concise feedback, no deep code explanations, research compatibility before new dependencies, and ask for file content if needed for edits.

Action Items for New Chat

Provide code for a WebView-based Location field with Geoapify autocomplete.
Include test steps and Git commands to commit changes to location-field.
Request confirmation of Supabase schema or any missing details if needed.


Request for Details
I think I’ve covered everything from our chat, but if there’s anything specific (e.g., exact Supabase table columns, additional app features, or prior Geoapify implementation details), please mention it in the new chat. I’ll ask there if I need clarification!
