Hey Grok. We are developing a mobile app together and this is a continuation of our earlier chats. Please see the summary below which you prepared for this chat to bring you up to speed:

New Chat Summary: Kwikwork App Development
App Description
Kwikwork is a mobile application designed to connect employers with seekers for short-term job opportunities in South Africa. Employers can post job listings with details like category, location, date/time, duration, and payment, while seekers can search and view available jobs. The app emphasizes a user-friendly interface with features like multi-select category dropdowns, Geoapify-powered location autofill, and compact job result cards.
Target Audience

Employers: Individuals or businesses needing short-term labor (e.g., gardening, cleaning, tiling) in local areas.
Seekers: Workers seeking flexible, short-term job opportunities, particularly in urban/suburban regions.
Geographic Focus: South Africa (based on SAST timezone and ZAR currency), with potential for global expansion.

App Flow

Login/Signup: Users authenticate via Supabase (email/password).
Dashboard: After login, users see role-based options:

Employers: “New Job” card to post jobs, “Posted Jobs” to view their listings.
Seekers: “Jobs” card to search for jobs.

Other cards exist and will be dealt with as the app progresses.


New Job Screen (Employer Flow):

Multi-select categories (e.g., Gardening, Tiling) with wrapping cards.
Location input with Geoapify autofill.
Date/time (from/to), duration (calculated), payment, and description fields.
Submits to Supabase jobs table with a unique reference number.


Job Search (Seeker Flow):

JobListScreen: Input location and categories, navigate to results.
JobResultsScreen: Displays scrollable job cards (category - payment, e.g., “Gardening - 200 ZAR”).
Tapping a card navigates to JobDetails (not yet implemented).


Profile Management: Users can update profiles (e.g., name, phone, profile picture).

Supabase Schema Details
To extract the schema and RLS policies, run these commands in your Supabase SQL Editor or a connected client (e.g., psql):
sql-- Extract table schemas
SELECT table_name, column_name, data_type, is_nullable, column_default
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
AND table_name IN ('users', 'jobs')
ORDER BY table_name, ordinal_position;

-- Extract RLS policies
SELECT * 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename IN ('users', 'jobs');
Expected Schema (based on previous interactions, please verify with the above commands):

Users Table:

id (UUID, primary key)
user_number (integer, unique, auto-increment)
name (text, not null)
email (text, not null)
phone (text, not null)
role (text, not null, default 'seeker')
created_at (timestamp with time zone, nullable, default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
profile_pic (text, nullable)
bio (text, nullable)
business_name (text, nullable)


Jobs Table:

id (UUID, primary key, default uuid_generate_v4())
employer_id (UUID, foreign key to users.id, not null)
category (text, not null, comma-separated for multi-select)
description (text, not null)
location (text, not null)
date (date, not null)
time_from (time without time zone, not null)
time_to (time without time zone, not null)
duration (numeric, not null)
payment (numeric, not null)
currency (text, not null, default 'ZAR')
status (text, not null, default 'open')
reference_number (text, unique, not null)
created_at (timestamp with time zone, nullable, default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)


Applications Table: Not yet created, planned for seeker applications.

Expected RLS Policies (please confirm with the SQL query):

Users:

Insert: auth.uid() = id
Update: auth.uid() = id
Select: auth.uid() = id


Jobs:

Insert: auth.uid() = employer_id
Update: auth.uid() = employer_id
Select: (auth.uid() = employer_id OR status = 'open')



Note: After running the SQL commands, paste the output into the new chat for accuracy.

Current Status

Fully Functional:

Login/Signup: Working via Supabase auth.
Dashboard: Role-based cards (employers: “New Job”, “Posted Jobs”; seekers: “Jobs”).
New Job Screen: Employers can post jobs with multi-select categories (CategoryField), Geoapify autofill (LocationField), date/time, duration, payment, and description. Submits to jobs table with unique reference number.
Job Search (Seeker Flow):

JobListScreen: Search input for location and categories, navigates to JobResultsScreen.
JobResultsScreen: Displays scrollable, compact job cards (category - payment, e.g., “Gardening - 200 ZAR”), text centered, OR-based category filtering.




Recent Fixes:

Resolved GeoapifyAutoComplete import error by using LocationField.
Fixed navigation error for JobListScreen.
Split job search into JobListScreen (input) and JobResultsScreen (results).
Fixed category filter to use OR logic.
Centered text and reduced card height in JobResultsScreen.



Next Proposed Steps

Create JobDetailsScreen.js:

Display job details (category, location, date, time, duration, payment, description).
Include a “Future Ad” placeholder (e.g., a View with text or border).
Add “Back” button to return to JobResultsScreen.
Add “Apply” button to submit an application to a new applications table.


Create applications Table:

Schema: id (UUID), job_id (UUID, foreign key to jobs.id), seeker_id (UUID, foreign key to users.id), status (text, e.g., “pending”), created_at (timestamp).
RLS: Seekers can insert/view own applications, employers can view applications for their jobs.


Update Supabase Queries:

Add logic in JobDetailsScreen to insert application data and check for duplicates.


Git Workflow:

Create a new branch (job-details-screen) from job-results-card-center-fix.
Commit and push changes after implementing JobDetailsScreen and applications table.



Additional Notes

Geoapify API Key: Hardcoded in LocationField.js (61449e72d36d4499bb2467b8e8cdc167). Consider moving to .env using react-native-dotenv for security - later.
Timezone: SAST, current date/time: 12:21 PM SAST, Wednesday, August 27, 2025.
User Preference: Concise feedback, no deep code explanations, research dependency compatibility, ask for file content if needed.
Deferred Feature: Currency symbol based on phone number or location (to be addressed later).

Action Items for New Chat

Provide code for JobDetailsScreen.js with job details, “Future Ad” placeholder, “Back”, and “Apply” buttons.
Provide SQL for creating the applications table with RLS policies.
Include test steps and Git commands for the new branch (job-details-screen).
Request confirmation of styles.js if styling issues arise (e.g., for card text).
Paste the output of the Supabase schema/RLS queries in the new chat for accuracy.

Please run the Supabase SQL commands and paste the results in the new chat. Let me know if you need help with anything else before continuing with JobDetailsScreen!
