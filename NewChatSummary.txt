Our Current Project Status

The app successfully loads the profile screen after login, displaying role-specific content (bio for seekers, business name for employers) fetched from Supabase. Previous errors (e.g., ReferenceError: Property 'Platform' doesn't exist, Invariant Violation: ScrollView child layout) have been resolved by simplifying the code, fixing ScrollView styling, and ensuring proper imports. The screen currently shows plain text with centered alignment, styled with a basic card layout using theme/styles.js. The last successful log showed user 4dbf4168-d4e4-4aab-8187-2e1d2750ee17 (email: ww1@kw.com) fetched with role 'seeker', and the data (including bio) is displaying correctly. The profile picture widget and editing functionality are pending.
Relevant Information for Next Chat

Key Progress: The profile screen now fetches and displays real user data based on role, with a basic styled layout. The ScrollView issue is fixed, and Supabase integration is working.
Next Steps: Enhance the styling to match the attached example from the previous project (assumed card-like layout with labeled fields). Add the profile picture widget and editable fields (e.g., phone, bio, business name) with a save button once styling is confirmed.
Debug Tips: Check console logs for Supabase fetch errors if data is missing. If styling doesn’t match the example, share a description or adjust profileContainer and fieldRow styles. Verify users table data for ww1@kw.com and ee1@kw.com.
Supabase Considerations: Ensure bio, business_name, and profile_pic columns are populated in the users table. Adjust RLS policies if insert/update operations fail.
Environment Notes: The downgrade of react-native-safe-area-context to 5.4.0 and react-native-screens to ~4.11.1 resolved compatibility issues with Expo ~53.0.20.
Git Workflow: Continue using the feature/profile-screen branch for enhancements, merging to main once stable.

Recommendation

Start the new chat with a screenshot or detailed description of the desired styling from the previous project example to refine the layout. Share the latest ProfileScreen.js log output to confirm data fetch. Bring up any specific styling preferences (e.g., colors, spacing) or issues to prioritize tweaks. Let’s aim to add the profile pic and editing features next.
